ScholarSnap is a web-based application designed to bridge the gap between students and scholarship opportunities. It provides a centralized, intelligent platform that simplifies the process of finding, filtering, and applying for scholarships.

The platform is built for students who often struggle with:

Information overload – too many scattered scholarship sources.

Eligibility confusion – complex and varied criteria.

Time-consuming searches – manual browsing across multiple websites.

By offering personalized scholarship suggestions, eligibility checks, and direct application links, ScholarSnap helps students focus more on their studies while ensuring they never miss out on financial aid opportunities.
