- `PUT /api/profile` - Update user profile

**Features:**
- File-based profile storage (JSON)
- Comprehensive profile fields

---

## Architecture Pattern

### Service-Based Architecture
All business logic has been moved to dedicated Service classes:

```
Controller → Service → Model → Database
     ↑          ↑
Form Request   Response
Validation     Resource
```

**Benefits:**
- Separation of concerns
- Easier testing
- Reusable business logic
- Cleaner controllers
- Single Responsibility Principle

---

## Code Quality Improvements

### 1. Form Request Validation
- **Before:** Inline validation in controllers
- **After:** Dedicated Form Request classes with custom messages

### 2. Response Formatting
- **Before:** Manual array building
- **After:** Resource classes for consistent JSON structure

### 3. Business Logic
- **Before:** In controllers (hard to test)
- **After:** In service classes (easy to test and reuse)

### 4. Error Handling
- **Before:** Inconsistent error responses
- **After:** Standardized error handling with try-catch blocks

### 5. Role-Based Access
- **Before:** Complex inline checks
- **After:** Clean service methods with proper scoping

---

## Database Models

### Models Used
- `User` - Users (students, admins)
- `Scholarship` - Scholarship opportunities
- `Application` - Student applications
- `University` - Universities
- `Institute` - Institutes/Colleges

### Relationships
```
University → hasMany → Institutes
University → hasMany → Scholarships
Institute → hasMany → Scholarships
User → hasMany → Applications
Scholarship → hasMany → Applications
```

│   └── DELETE /{id}
│
└── /profile (auth)
    ├── GET /
    └── PUT /
```

## Security Features

1. **Authentication**: Laravel Sanctum tokens
2. **Authorization**: Role-based middleware
3. **Validation**: Form Requests with strict rules
4. **Password Security**: 
   - Bcrypt hashing
   - Strong password requirements
   - Compromised password checking
5. **SQL Injection**: Eloquent ORM protection
6. **XSS Protection**: JSON responses
7. **CORS**: Properly configured

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests
```php
// Service classes
- AuthService::register()
- AuthService::login()
- ScholarshipService::createScholarship()
- ApplicationService::createApplication()
```

### Feature Tests
```php
// API endpoints
- POST /api/auth/register
- POST /api/auth/login
- GET /api/scholarships
- POST /api/applications
```

### Role-based Tests
```php
- Student can view public scholarships
- Student cannot create scholarships
- Admin can create scholarships
- University admin can only manage their scholarships
```

---

## Migration from Old to New

### Breaking Changes
None - The new API is backward compatible with existing routes.

### What Changed
1. **ScholarshipController**: Refactored to use service pattern
2. **New Files**: Added Form Requests, Resources, Services
3. **Better Structure**: Cleaner, more maintainable code

### What Stayed the Same
- All endpoint URLs
- Request/Response formats
- Authentication mechanism
- Database schema

---

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Eager Loading**: Prevent N+1 queries
   ```php
   ->with(['university:id,name', 'institute:id,name'])
   ```

2. **Pagination**: All list endpoints support pagination
   ```php
   ?per_page=15
   ```

3. **Query Scoping**: Database-level filtering
   ```php
   // Filtered at query level, not in memory
   ```

4. **Resource Collections**: Efficient data transformation

---

## Next Development Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ Authentication system
2. ✅ Scholarship CRUD
3. ✅ Application submission
4. ✅ Profile management

### Recommended Next
1. File upload for application documents
2. Email notifications
3. Admin dashboard analytics
4. Advanced search with filters
5. Export functionality (PDF reports)
6. Bulk operations for admins

### Future Enhancements
1. Real-time notifications (WebSockets)
2. Application status tracking timeline
3. Document verification system
4. Payment integration (if needed)
5. Multi-language support
6. Mobile app API enhancements
